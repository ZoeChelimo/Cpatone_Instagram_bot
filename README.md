## Introduction
This project automates interactions with Instagram using Python. It can perform tasks such as liking posts, following users, and posting comments. The project uses Selenium for web automation and can be extended to use Instagram's API for more advanced functionalities.

## Features
- Automatically like posts based on hashtags or user profiles.
- Follow or unfollow users.
- Post comments on selected posts.
- Scheduled automation tasks.
- Detailed logging of actions performed.


## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/instagram-automation.git
    cd instagram-automation
    ```

2. **Create and Activate Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Download Web Driver**:
    - Download the appropriate WebDriver for your browser (e.g., ChromeDriver for Chrome).
    - Make sure the WebDriver is in your system PATH or specify its path in the configuration.



## Usage
1. **Configure the Script**:
    - Open `config.py` and update the configuration settings such as Instagram credentials, hashtags, or profiles to target, and paths to WebDriver.

2. **Run the Script**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3. **Scheduling Tasks**:
    - Use a task scheduler like `cron` on Unix systems or Task Scheduler on Windows to run the script at regular intervals.
