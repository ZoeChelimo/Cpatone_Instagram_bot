- Follow or unfollow users.
- Post comments on selected posts.
- Scheduled automation tasks.
- Detailed logging of actions performed.

2. **Run the Script**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3. **Scheduling Tasks**:
    - Use a task scheduler like `cron` on Unix systems or Task Scheduler on Windows to run the script at regular intervals.
